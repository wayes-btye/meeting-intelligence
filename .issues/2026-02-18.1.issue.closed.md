## Description
Set up project structure (src/ layout), Docker Compose (api + ui services), Pydantic BaseSettings config, Supabase schema (meetings, chunks, extracted_items tables with pgvector), .env.example, Makefile.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `src/` directory structure: `api/`, `ingestion/`, `retrieval/`, `extraction/`, `evaluation/`, `ui/`
- [ ] Docker Compose with `api` (FastAPI) and `ui` (Streamlit) services
- [ ] Pydantic BaseSettings config with validation
- [ ] Supabase schema: `meetings`, `chunks`, `extracted_items` tables with pgvector extension
- [ ] `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- [ ] `Makefile` with standard commands (api, streamlit, test, lint, format)
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` with dependencies and tool config (ruff, mypy, pytest)

## Acceptance Criteria
- `docker compose up` starts both services
- Database tables exist in Supabase
- Config validates on startup (fails fast on missing keys)

**Post-merge audit finding:**

Two items from the acceptance criteria were not completed:

1. **CI/CD pipeline missing.** The acceptance criteria specified "CI runs on push (lint + pytest placeholder)" and the planning docs called for `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. No `.github/` directory exists — the project has no CI pipeline.

2. **Config validation does not fail fast on missing keys.** The acceptance criteria stated "Config validates on startup (fails fast on missing keys)," but all API keys in `src/config.py` default to empty strings (`anthropic_api_key: str = ""`). This means the config silently accepts missing keys instead of raising a validation error at startup. The failure surfaces later as cryptic API client errors.

These items were missed and need to be addressed in a follow-up issue.
