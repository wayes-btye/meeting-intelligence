**Labels**: `bug`, `infrastructure`

Two cleanup items:

### 1. Duplicate extract endpoint
There's a buggy GET `/api/meetings/{id}/extract` in `meetings.py` alongside the correct POST version in `extraction.py`. The GET version has a serialization bug (returns dataclass instances instead of Pydantic models) and is semantically wrong (extraction is a write operation). Remove the GET version.

### 2. Missing CI pipeline
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` was specified in Issue #1 acceptance criteria but never created. Add a basic GitHub Actions workflow running:
- `ruff check`
- `mypy`
- `pytest`
