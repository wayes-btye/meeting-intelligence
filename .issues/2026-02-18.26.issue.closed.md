The download script has been run (30 JSON files in `data/meetingbank/`) but data was never loaded into the live Supabase instance. Issue #5 acceptance criteria required "30+ meetings queryable in the system."

Run `python scripts/load_meetingbank.py --max 30` against the live Supabase instance so the demo has actual data to query.

MeetingBank data loaded successfully. 30 meetings ingested into Supabase with speaker_turn chunking. Total chunks: ~250 across Denver City Council, Long Beach CC, Boston CC, and Seattle City Council meetings. 0 errors. Run manually from main workspace 2026-02-20.
