# [\#26 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/26) `open`: Load MeetingBank data into Supabase
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `data`

The download script has been run (30 JSON files in `data/meetingbank/`) but data was never loaded into the live Supabase instance. Issue #5 acceptance criteria required "30+ meetings queryable in the system."

Run `python scripts/load_meetingbank.py --max 30` against the live Supabase instance so the demo has actual data to query.
