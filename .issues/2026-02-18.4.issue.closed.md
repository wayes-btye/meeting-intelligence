**Labels**: `foundation`

## Description
Basic Streamlit interface: upload transcript/audio, browse meetings, ask questions, see answers with sources. Thin client that calls FastAPI over HTTP.

## Tasks
- [ ] File upload page (transcript or audio)
- [ ] Meeting browser / list view
- [ ] Query interface with text input
- [ ] Answer display with source attribution
- [ ] Loading states and error handling
- [ ] Connect to FastAPI backend via HTTP

## Acceptance Criteria
- End-to-end flow works in browser: upload -> query -> see answer with sources
- UI is a thin client (no business logic, just API calls)

## Progress: Streamlit UI in progress

Branch: `feat/4-streamlit-ui`

Building:
- Multi-page layout (Upload, Ask Questions, Meetings)
- HTTP client wrapper for FastAPI calls
- Sidebar navigation with API health status
- File upload with chunking strategy selection
- Query interface with answer + source display
- Meeting browser with detail view

API endpoints don't exist yet (Issue 3), so UI handles missing endpoints gracefully.

## Completed

PR: #11

Files created:
- `src/ui/app.py` — multi-page Streamlit app (Upload, Ask Questions, Meetings)
- `src/ui/api_client.py` — HTTP client wrapper for FastAPI

Lint clean, format clean. Waiting on Issue #3 for full API integration.

**Post-merge audit finding:**

The meeting detail view in `src/ui/app.py` uses field names that do not match the actual API response schema. This means the meetings browser page displays "N/A" values and never renders extracted items correctly.

Specific mismatches:
- `meeting.get("date", "N/A")` — the API returns `created_at`, not `date`
- `meeting.get("num_chunks", "N/A")` — the API returns `chunk_count`, not `num_chunks`
- `detail.get("action_items", [])` — the API returns `extracted_items` as a flat list, not separate `action_items`/`decisions`/`topics` lists
- `item.get("owner", "Unassigned")` — the extraction data uses `assignee`, not `owner`
- `item.get("text", "")` — the extraction data uses `content`, not `text`

These field name mismatches mean the meetings page does not display data correctly — metadata shows "N/A" and extracted items never appear even when they exist in the database.

This needs to be addressed in a follow-up issue.
