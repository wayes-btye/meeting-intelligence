## Description
Download and process 30-50 meetings from MeetingBank HuggingFace dataset. Parse into standard format, ingest through pipeline.

## Tasks
- [ ] Download MeetingBank dataset from HuggingFace
- [ ] Select curated subset of 30-50 meetings with good variety
- [ ] Parse MeetingBank format into standard transcript format
- [ ] Batch ingest through existing pipeline
- [ ] Verify cross-meeting queries work

## Acceptance Criteria
- 30+ meetings queryable in the system
- Cross-meeting queries work (e.g., "Which meetings discussed budget?")
- Meeting metadata (date, title, speakers) properly stored

Completed in PR #14 (merged). Implemented:
- `scripts/download_meetingbank.py` — downloads MeetingBank dataset from HuggingFace
- `scripts/load_meetingbank.py` — parses and ingests meetings through the pipeline
- Added `data/` to .gitignore for downloaded files

**Post-merge audit finding:**

The download script (`scripts/download_meetingbank.py`) works and 30 JSON files exist in `data/meetingbank/`. However, the data was likely never loaded into Supabase.

- The acceptance criteria required "30+ meetings queryable in the system" — this was not achieved.
- The load script (`scripts/load_meetingbank.py`) requires live Supabase and OpenAI credentials and makes real API calls. There is no evidence of a successful load (no logs, no reports, no pre-populated data).
- If someone clones the repo and runs `docker compose up`, they get an empty system with no meetings to query.

The download script works but the data was not loaded into the live system. The acceptance criteria for queryable meetings was not met.

This needs to be addressed in a follow-up issue.
