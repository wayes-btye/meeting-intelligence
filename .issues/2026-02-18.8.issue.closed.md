**Labels**: `pipeline`

## Description
Extract structured data from meetings (action items with assignees, decisions, key topics). Store in extracted_items table. Query routing: structured queries go to DB, open-ended go to RAG.

## Tasks
- [ ] Action item extraction with assignees and deadlines
- [ ] Decision extraction with context
- [ ] Key topic extraction
- [ ] Store extracted items in extracted_items table
- [ ] Query routing: detect structured vs open-ended questions
- [ ] Structured queries hit DB directly (fast, precise)
- [ ] Open-ended queries go through RAG pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria
- "What action items were assigned?" returns structured results from DB
- "What was discussed about the budget?" goes through RAG
- Extracted items have proper metadata (meeting, speaker, timestamp)

Completed in PR #17 (merged). Implemented:
- Claude-powered extraction using `tool_use` for structured output
- Query router: structured queries → DB lookup, open-ended → RAG pipeline
- POST /api/meetings/{id}/extract endpoint
- Integration with ingestion pipeline (optional `extract` parameter)
- 31 new tests, all passing

**Post-merge audit finding:**

A duplicate extract endpoint exists and needs cleanup.

- `GET /api/meetings/{meeting_id}/extract` is defined in `src/api/routes/meetings.py`
- `POST /api/meetings/{meeting_id}/extract` is defined in `src/api/routes/extraction.py`

Both do the same thing (trigger extraction), but:
- The GET version is semantically wrong — extraction is a write operation that stores results in the database, so it should not use GET.
- The GET version has a serialization bug: it returns `ExtractedItem` dataclass instances directly where `ExtractedItemResponse` Pydantic models are expected, which will cause serialization errors.
- The POST version in `extraction.py` correctly converts between types and is the proper implementation.

The duplicate GET endpoint in `meetings.py` needs to be removed.

This needs to be addressed in a follow-up issue.
