# [\#31 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/31) `open`: chore: cloud deployment — Cloud Run (API) + Vercel (frontend)

## Goal

Deploy the system to cloud so the assessor can run it without local setup.

## Scope

**1. API → Google Cloud Run**
- Add `cloudbuild.yaml` or GitHub Actions deploy workflow
- Inject secrets via Cloud Run env vars (same keys as `.env`)
- Health check at `/health` already exists
- Target: `docker compose up` locally stays unchanged; Cloud Run is an additional deploy target

**2. Frontend → Vercel (once React UI exists)**
- Once Issue #32 (React frontend) is done, Vercel deploy is a `vercel.json` + push
- Streamlit retained for local dev only

**3. GitHub Actions workflow**
- `deploy.yml` triggered on push to `main` (or manual dispatch)
- Builds and pushes Docker image to GCR, deploys to Cloud Run

## Acceptance Criteria

- **1.** `POST /ingest` + `POST /query` work end-to-end from a public Cloud Run URL
- **2.** All secrets injected via environment (not committed)
- **3.** README updated with live demo URL

## Dependencies

- Issue #32 (React frontend) must be done before deploying frontend to Vercel
- Issue #26 (MeetingBank data) must be done before the demo is meaningful

## Notes

User has access to both Google Cloud and Vercel. Cloud Run chosen for API because FastAPI containerises cleanly and billing is per-request. Vercel chosen for React frontend because it's zero-config for Next.js.
