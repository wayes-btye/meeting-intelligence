# [\#32 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/32) `open`: feat: React/Next.js frontend to replace Streamlit for demo

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151667361?v=4" width="50">[wayes-btye](https://github.com/wayes-btye) opened issue at [2026-02-20 00:28](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/32):

## Goal

Replace Streamlit as the public-facing demo UI with a React/Next.js frontend. Streamlit is retained as a dev/debug tool.

## Why

- Streamlit reruns the entire script on each interaction — session state is fragile
- Not suitable for concurrent users or a polished demo
- React on Vercel is zero-config deployment, looks professional
- The FastAPI backend already has clean separation — zero API changes needed

## Scope

**New directory:** `/frontend/` (separate from `/src/`)

**Pages/views:**
- Upload page: drag-drop transcript upload, progress feedback, immediate extraction results display
- Chat page: question input, answer display with source citation cards
- Meetings browser: paginated list, click to see meeting detail and extracted items
- Strategy panel: sidebar toggle for chunking/retrieval strategy

**FastAPI changes (minimal):**
- Add CORS middleware (allow Vercel domain + localhost:3000)
- No endpoint changes

**Tech stack suggestion:** Next.js 14 + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Vercel-native deployment
- shadcn gives a polished default look with minimal CSS work
- File upload via standard `multipart/form-data` to `/ingest`

## Acceptance Criteria

- **1.** Upload a `.vtt` transcript, see immediate extraction results (action items, decisions)
- **2.** Ask a question in chat, see answer with source citations
- **3.** Browse meetings list and click to see meeting detail
- **4.** Strategy selector works (sends strategy params in query body)
- **5.** Deployable to Vercel with `vercel deploy`
- **6.** Streamlit still works for local dev (`make streamlit` unchanged)

## Related

- Issue #31 (cloud deployment) — depends on this for frontend deploy
- Issue #35 (Gemini visual summary) — upload page should display visual summary once #35 is done
- PRD: F65
