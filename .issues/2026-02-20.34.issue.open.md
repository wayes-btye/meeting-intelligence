# [\#34 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/34) `open`: feat: zip file upload for bulk ingestion + Microsoft Teams VTT format support

## Goal

Two related improvements that make the system usable with real-world enterprise transcripts:

## Part 1: Zip File Upload

**Problem:** Assessors and users likely have folders of meeting transcripts. Currently they must upload files one at a time.

**Solution:** Accept `.zip` files in the ingest endpoint. Extract and ingest each `.vtt`/`.txt`/`.json` file inside as a separate meeting.

**Implementation:**
- Detect `content-type: application/zip` or `.zip` extension in `POST /ingest`
- Extract to temp directory, iterate files, call ingest pipeline per file
- Return a batch result: `{"meetings_ingested": 5, "meeting_ids": [...], "errors": [...]}`
- UI: show bulk upload progress (N of M processed)

## Part 2: Microsoft Teams VTT Format

**Problem:** Teams exports `.vtt` files using WebVTT with inline speaker tags:
```
WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v John Smith>This is what John said.</v>
```

Our current VTT parser likely handles the timestamp blocks but does NOT parse `<v SpeakerName>` inline tags — speaker labels would be lost or appear as literal text in chunks.

**Solution:**
- Update `VTTParser` to detect and strip `<v SpeakerName>` tags, extracting speaker name from the tag
- Add test: `test_vtt_parser_teams_format()` with a real Teams-style fixture
- Add `tests/fixtures/teams_sample.vtt` as a minimal Teams VTT example

**Why it matters:** The assessor likely has Teams meeting transcripts. If they try uploading one and speaker attribution breaks, it reflects poorly. This is a quick fix that makes the demo robust to real-world input.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Zip upload:**
- **1.** Upload a `.zip` containing 3 `.vtt` files via `POST /ingest`
- **2.** 3 separate meetings created in Supabase
- **3.** Batch result returned with all 3 meeting IDs

**Teams format:**
- **1.** `tests/fixtures/teams_sample.vtt` exists with `<v SpeakerName>` tag format
- **2.** `test_vtt_parser_teams_format()` passes — speaker labels correctly extracted
- **3.** Chunks from a Teams VTT file have correct `speaker` field populated
