# [\#43 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/43) `open`: feat: show meeting title on source cards in chat
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `ui`

## Problem
When querying across "All meetings", source cards show the chunk content, speaker, and similarity — but not which meeting the chunk came from. This makes cross-meeting retrieval invisible in the UI.

This is a core selling point of the system and should be visible in the demo.

## What needs to change

**Backend — `src/retrieval/search.py`:**
The semantic and hybrid search functions query the `chunks` table. Add a join to pull `meetings.title`:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT chunks.*, meetings.title as meeting_title
FROM chunks
JOIN meetings ON chunks.meeting_id = meetings.id
WHERE ...
\`\`\`

Or use Supabase's embedded select: `.select("*, meetings(title)")`.

**`src/api/models.py`** — add `meeting_title: str | None` to `ChunkResult`.

**Frontend — `frontend/app/chat/page.tsx`:**
Show meeting title as a small badge or subtitle on each source card when the selected meeting is "All meetings".

## Test plan
- [ ] Query across all meetings — each source card shows the meeting title
- [ ] Single-meeting query still works
- [ ] `meeting_title` field present in API response
- [ ] Unit tests updated to include `meeting_title` in mock responses

## Effort
Small — backend join + one extra field in model + badge in UI.
