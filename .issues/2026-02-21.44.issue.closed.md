## Problem
When naive chunking is used (or when a transcript has no speaker labels), `speaker` is `null`. The speaker badge in source cards renders as empty or shows "undefined".

Same issue on the Meetings page where `num_speakers` is null — the display should gracefully handle this.

## Fix

**Chat source cards (`frontend/app/chat/page.tsx`):**
\`\`\`tsx
// Before: always renders badge
<Badge>{chunk.speaker}</Badge>

// After: only render if speaker is set
{chunk.speaker && <Badge>{chunk.speaker}</Badge>}
// Or show a fallback:
<Badge variant="outline">{chunk.speaker ?? 'Unknown speaker'}</Badge>
\`\`\`

**Meetings list — num_speakers column:**
Show `—` or `Unknown` instead of `null` / empty.

## Test plan
- [ ] Upload a plain `.txt` file (no speaker labels) — source cards show fallback, no empty badge
- [ ] Meetings list shows `—` for meetings with null `num_speakers`

## Effort
2–4 lines. Pure frontend.

Implementation complete on branch `feat/41-44-frontend-polish`.

Two fixes:
- Chat source cards: speaker badge conditionally renders 'Unknown speaker' (outline variant) when `speaker` is null
- Meetings list: `num_speakers` null handling was already correct with `—` fallback (no change needed)

`npm run build` passing cleanly.
