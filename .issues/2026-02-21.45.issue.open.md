# [\#45 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/45) `open`: feat: projects — data namespacing without authentication
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `pipeline`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151667361?v=4" width="50">[wayes-btye](https://github.com/wayes-btye) opened issue at [2026-02-21 01:44](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/45):

## Problem
All meetings share a single namespace. When demonstrating the app, dev/test uploads are mixed in with demo data. The assessor sees clutter.

Full authentication is deliberately not wanted — it adds complexity and failure points for what is a single-assessor demo.

## Solution: Projects (namespacing, no auth)

A **project** is a name/slug in the DB. Every meeting belongs to a project. The UI has a project selector in the nav — all meetings, queries, and uploads are scoped to it. No login, no passwords, no sessions.

### Implementation

**1. DB migration — add `project_id` to `meetings`:**
\`\`\`sql
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN project_id text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default';
CREATE INDEX idx_meetings_project_id ON meetings(project_id);
\`\`\`

**2. API — `project_id` as optional param (defaults to `'default'`):**
- `POST /api/ingest` — accept `project_id` form field
- `GET /api/meetings` — filter by `project_id`
- `POST /api/query` — pass `project_id` to search functions

**3. Frontend — project selector in nav:**
- Dropdown showing available projects (fetched from a new `GET /api/projects` endpoint, or inferred from distinct `project_id` values on meetings)
- Selection persisted in `localStorage`
- All API calls include the selected project

### Usage for assessment
- Create an `assessment` project pre-loaded with clean council meetings
- Dev noise stays in `default`
- Assessor opens app, selects `assessment` project, sees clean data

### What this does NOT require
- No login, no sessions, no tokens, no user management
- No new dependencies

## Test plan
- [ ] Ingest two meetings with different project IDs — each only visible in its project
- [ ] Query scoped to project — no cross-project leakage
- [ ] Project selector persists across page refreshes (localStorage)
- [ ] Migration runs cleanly, existing meetings default to `'default'` project
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Effort
Medium — one DB migration + API param threading + small frontend nav component.

**Do before the assessment is scheduled.**
