# [\#47 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/47) `closed`: feat: chunk viewer in meeting detail panel
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `ui`, `post-mvp`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151667361?v=4" width="50">[wayes-btye](https://github.com/wayes-btye) opened issue at [2026-02-21 01:44](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/47):

## Problem
Clicking a meeting shows extracted items (action items, decisions, topics) but not the actual transcript chunks. There's no way to verify chunking quality from the UI.

## What the API already returns
\`GET /api/meetings/{id}\` returns a full \`chunks\` array with \`content\`, \`speaker\`, \`start_time\`, \`end_time\` for every chunk (\`meetings.py:73-81\`). The data is there; the UI doesn't display it.

## Proposed UI
Add a collapsible "Chunks" section (or a second tab) in the \`MeetingDetailPanel\`. Each chunk shown as a card:
- Speaker badge
- Timestamp badge (\`start_time\` → \`end_time\`)
- Chunk index
- Content text

Also include a "Full Transcript" toggle — raw transcript is already in \`GET /api/meetings/{id}\` as \`raw_transcript\`.

## Effort
Medium — pure frontend, ~50 lines, no API changes needed.

Implementation complete on branch `feat/47-chunk-viewer`.

**What was built:**
- Collapsible Chunks section below extracted items — shows `#index` badge, speaker badge (or "Unknown speaker"), mm:ss timestamp range (formatted from float seconds), and chunk content text
- Collapsible Full Transcript toggle showing `raw_transcript` in a scrollable pre block
- Pure frontend only — no API changes; data already present in `GET /api/meetings/{id}` response

**Implementation notes:**
- Used `<details>/<summary>` pattern — no new component imports needed
- Chunk index uses array position `i` (chunks returned pre-ordered by `chunk_index` from API, but `chunk_index` field not included in `SourceChunk` response shape)
- Timestamps formatted as `mm:ss` via new `formatSeconds()` helper
- Both sections collapsed by default, max-height 96 with scroll for large meetings

**Automated checks:**
- `npm run build` clean (TypeScript compiles without errors)
- All 117 pytest tests pass (no backend changes, regression check)

PR #59 open for review — worktree at `C:\meeting-intelligence-wt13-issue-47` intact for manual testing.
