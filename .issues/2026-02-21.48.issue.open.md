## Problem
The meetings list doesn't show which chunking strategy was used (naive vs speaker-turn). Each chunk row has a \`strategy\` column in the DB, but the meetings list endpoint only returns a count.

## Solution

**Option 1 (correct):** Add \`chunking_strategy\` column to the \`meetings\` table, populate on ingest.
\`\`\`sql
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN chunking_strategy text;
\`\`\`

Update \`store_meeting()\` in \`src/ingestion/storage.py\` to write the strategy.

**Option 2 (avoid):** Infer from first chunk at query time — extra DB query per meeting in list view, not worth it.

## Effort
Medium — one Supabase migration + ingest change + UI column in meetings table.

**Note:** Coordinate with any other migration running at the same time (shares \`meetings\` schema with #45 projects/namespacing).
