# [\#51 PR](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/pull/51) `merged`: chore: switch Cloud Run deploy to Cloud Build (remove push trigger from deploy.yml)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151667361?v=4" width="50">[wayes-btye](https://github.com/wayes-btye) opened issue at [2026-02-21 07:41](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/pull/51):

Follow-up to #50.

Cloud Run continuous deployment is being set up via Cloud Build connected directly to GitHub (console UI), not GitHub Actions. Removes the `push: branches: [main]` trigger from `deploy.yml` to avoid double-deploys — the workflow is kept as `workflow_dispatch` only for manual fallback.

Also updates `docs/worktrees/wt7-issue-31.md` to reflect the actual approach.
