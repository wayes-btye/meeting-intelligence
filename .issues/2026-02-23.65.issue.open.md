# [\#65 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/65) `open`: feat: grid-search hybrid search weights against evaluation data
**Labels**: `evaluation`, `retrieval`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151667361?v=4" width="50">[wayes-btye](https://github.com/wayes-btye) opened issue at [2026-02-23 11:35](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/65):

## Context

Current hybrid search weights are 70% vector / 30% full-text — these are defaults, not optimised values. The architecture doc acknowledges this explicitly.

**Depends on:** #64 (evaluation must produce data first)

## Approach

With evaluation data available, run a simple grid search across weight combinations and record metric scores:

```python
for vector_weight in [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]:
    fts_weight = 1 - vector_weight
    # run evaluation subset with these weights
    # record per-query-category scores
```

**Expected outcome:** Different optimal weights per query type:
- **Attribution queries** ("what did X say about Y?") — higher FTS weight (speaker name matching)
- **Semantic/exploratory queries** — higher vector weight
- **Mixed queries** — somewhere in between

This moves `docs/architecture.md` from "70/30 are reasonable defaults" to "70/30 is the data-driven setting for general use" — or surfaces that a different default is better.

## What Changes

- `src/retrieval/hybrid_search.py` — make weights configurable per query type (may already be)
- `docs/architecture.md` — update hybrid search section with tuned values and rationale
- `reports/weight_tuning_results.json` — grid search output committed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Grid search run across at least 5 weight combinations
- [ ] Results broken down by query category (factual, attribution, exploratory)
- [ ] Architecture doc updated with evidence-based weight recommendations
- [ ] Default weights updated in `PipelineConfig` if data supports a change
