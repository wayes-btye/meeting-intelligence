# [\#67 Issue](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/67) `open`: feat: cross-encoder reranking as optional post-retrieval stage
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `retrieval`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151667361?v=4" width="50">[wayes-btye](https://github.com/wayes-btye) opened issue at [2026-02-23 11:35](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/issues/67):

## Background

The current retrieval pipeline returns the top-K chunks by cosine similarity (or hybrid score). A **cross-encoder reranker** adds a second pass: it scores each retrieved chunk against the full query text using a more expensive but more accurate model, then re-orders before generation.

Benchmarks show **15–40% precision improvement** for RAG pipelines with reranking added.

## Why It's Not in the MVP

Adds ~100–200ms latency per query. The right approach is to benchmark this cost against the measured precision gain from the evaluation framework (#64) before committing to it as a default.

## Implementation

**Model:** `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` via `sentence-transformers` — fast, small, well-tested for passage reranking. No API key required (runs locally).

**Pipeline change:**
```python
# Current: retrieve top-K, pass to generation
chunks = hybrid_search(query, top_k=5)

# With reranking: retrieve top-N, rerank, pass top-K to generation
candidates = hybrid_search(query, top_k=20)
chunks = cross_encoder_rerank(query, candidates, top_k=5)
```

**PipelineConfig addition:**
```python
reranking_strategy: Literal["none", "cross_encoder"] = "none"
```

## Evaluation Path

Run before/after evaluation (Issue #64) to measure:
- Context precision improvement (primary metric)
- Latency impact (measure p50 and p95 query latency)
- Whether the improvement justifies the latency for meeting intelligence use cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `cross_encoder_rerank()` implemented in `src/retrieval/`
- [ ] `PipelineConfig.reranking_strategy` toggle works
- [ ] Unit tested (mocked model)
- [ ] Latency measured and documented
- [ ] Evaluation comparison committed to `reports/`
