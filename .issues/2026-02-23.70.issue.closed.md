## Update

**This issue is superseded — the fix was implemented in the portfolio review pass (2026-02-23).**

See commit [3874038](https://github.com/wayes-btye/meeting-intelligence/commit/3874038) and the comment on the original bug issue #63 (now closed) for full details.

The fix added:
- `speaker_labels=True` to `aai.TranscriptionConfig`
- Utterances JSON returned from `_transcribe_audio` instead of `transcript.text`
- `transcript_format = "json"` in both single-file and zip audio paths

This issue can be closed.

Duplicate of #63 which was already fixed and closed. Created in error — closing immediately.
