00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Mayor Johnson: Good evening everyone. I'd like to call this meeting to order.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Council Member Davis: Thank you, Mayor. I move that we approve the minutes from last week's session.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Mayor Johnson: We have a motion on the floor. All in favor?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Council Member Smith: I second the motion. Aye.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Mayor Johnson: Motion carries. Let's move to the first agenda item - the proposed budget for the downtown revitalization project.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Council Member Davis: I've reviewed the budget proposal and I have some concerns about the allocation for infrastructure repairs. The current estimate of 2.3 million seems low given recent material cost increases.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Council Member Park: I agree with Council Member Davis. We should also consider the environmental impact assessment costs which aren't reflected in the current budget.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Mayor Johnson: These are valid concerns. I suggest we table the budget vote until next week and ask the finance committee to provide revised estimates.
